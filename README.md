# 2nd Partial Project: Spaceships Console Videogame

My project consists of a mini spaceship videogame that can be run in the windows console. 
Every time the game is run, the player has to enter a nickname to register the scores.
Thereâ€™s a menu at the start where the player chooses between *Play* and *Records*.

## Records

In the *Records* screen the game shows the five highest scores reached and the nickname of the players who obtained them. Every time the game ends the score is registered in a txt file that is read to print the highest scores, all the scores are sorted from highest to lowest.

## Play

If the player chose *Play*, the game starts and the player controls through the arrow keys a little spaceship at the bottom of the screen and can shoot a bullet pressing the arrow keys. From the top of the screen, enemy spaceships begin to appear in random positions and start to move downwards with the objective of getting through the player. If the player hits the enemy spaceship with a bullet, the enemy is destroyed and another one appears. 
There are three sizes of enemy spaceships, each of them rewards the player with a different score upon elimination and move at different speeds. The biggest one gives 150 points and moves one row each time, the medium one gives 250 points and moves two rows at the time, and the smallest one gives 500 points and moves three rows at the time.
The game ends when the player killed all the enemies or one of the enemies reach the bottom of the screen.
